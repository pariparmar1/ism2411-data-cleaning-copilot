Through this project I used copilot to help me clean a sales data file. I used some blocks of code and functions that came directly from Copilot's suggestions. Some functions that I used from copilot includes def load_data(file_path: str):. I prompted this by writing a comment saying that I wanted to upload a data file that I had in sales_data_raw. Furthermore, I also used block's of code from copilot's suggestions. An example of this is the section where I handled missing values. I promoted this by writign a comment on what I wanted to do and starting the line of code in which Copilot finished.
