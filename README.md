# ism2411-data-cleaning-copilot

This is my data cleaning project. This project is about cleaning data. Through this project I have cleaned a file containign sales data. The code in this project was dedicated to cleaning the sales data file. I was provided with a messy file of sales data and I coded it to make it look cleaner. Some of the cleaning steps included standardizing column names, stripping leading/trailling white space, handling missing prices and quantities, and removing rows with clarly invalid values.
Run instructions for this project include uploading a messy file that needs to be cleaned. Then the code will run through each part of the project and clean the file according to what is written in the code. The result will be a cleaned file.
